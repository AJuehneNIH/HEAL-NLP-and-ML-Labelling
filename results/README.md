- create a `predictions_ML/` - all label predictions for machine learning approaches taken are saved here. Includes labels for science types, primary outcome, and milestone variables. I can't include them here because the excel files include the textual data.
- create a `predictions_NLP/` - all label predictions for NLP, rule-based approaches taken are saved here. Includes labels for science types, primary outcome, and milestone variables. I can't include them here because the excel files include the textual data.
- `visuals/` - includes visuals of data distributions for each variable.

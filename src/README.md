### ALL PYTHON CODE

- `codes.py` - contains all keyterms/regular expressions used for labeling. Contains some terms pulled from RCDC. Make sure those files are contained in a respective RCDC folder. To pull excel file of existing term sets and ontologies being used, look inside folder `term_sets` and use function `read_excel`. 
- `preprocessing.py` - code to pre-process text; remove stop words, sentence filter, etc. current dataset files are saved in `cleaned_data` folder. Merges together pain + HEAL datasets, saves in  `cleaned_data` folder. Note this includes the code to create columns 'Combined Cleaned' for the text and 'Filtered Cleaned,' which utilizes the sentence wrapper searching for aim/objective centered words. Also prepares the dependent variable label columns for machine learning by converting science-type lists to individual labels of binary 1s/0s.  
- `text_utils.py` - contains various functions used in pre-processing, hyper-parameter tuning for the models, data visualizations, sentence wrapper, etc. Look at comments above each function for more details. 
- `key_term_search.py` - NLP, rule-based approaches to search for and count key terms to label. Label predictions saved to `predictions_NLP` under `results/'  
- `supervised_models.py` - supervised machine learning approaches to automate labeling. Includes various pipelines ex. Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression. Each have their own functions. Utilized TF-IDF to convert words to feature vectors. Performed dimensionality reduction on matrix using Truncated SVD; used SMOTE to oversample minority labels. Label predictions saved to `predictions_ML` under `results/`. Remember when using on new datasets to train using entire HEAL dataset (all 956 studies)--right now, for testing purposes, it is only being trained on 75% of the data.  
- `combine.py` - combined NLP and ML results to find where those models agree vs. disagree. Trust the labels where they both agree--double-check the mismatches. Final label predictions saved to `preds_final` under `results/`
- `unsupervised.py` - unsupervised machine learning approaches to uncover potential trends/patterns in the textual data.
